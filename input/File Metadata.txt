2020_GHDD_Harvest_Data_Metadata------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	This file contains all the data collected specifically during harvest, such as canopy biomass, root traits,
	gravimetric water content, etc. They are all in separate sheet, and units are defined on a units sheet.

	Aboveground Biomass Sheet Protocols: To calculate total leaf area, I divided the leaf wet weight by the partial wet weight and multiplied that value by the leaf area.
        If there were two bags for one plant, I added the total leaf areas up, then the Leaf wet weight, then the dry weights as well.
        If the leaf area was missing from bag two, I added the leaf wet weight of bag two to bag one, using the formula of bag 1 for all the biomass

controlwateradded126 & controlwateradded1213-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	These are days control plants recieved supplementary water becasue they had grown so large that the regular watering
	regime did not provide them with enough water to avoid stress. The watering on these days is currently added in into the code seperately,
	but likely could just be included in the WU_for_R.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Average empty pot weight calculations------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Empty pots for control and treatment were each averaged per each day of watering in r. With days where empty pot values weren't usable (calculations were wrong or people forgot to water.)
	the closest three days of the same watering volume were averaged and used (if control ep's are messed up, but should have been watered to 
	80%, and then three days passed before the next watering, I found the most recent day where control empty pots had that condition and use the average of the eps from that day)
	If three days aren't available, then I used two or one day, as much as there was. I then subtracted the average ep water use per day per treatment from each plant.
	Units are water added in kg.

gsw_6800_cleaned.csv/.xlsx------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Licor 6800 point measurements cleaned based on stomatal conductance values using the protocols described in the xlsx metadata tab:
	
	"First I removed gsw values below zero, then I used the three sigma rule to remove outliers, although I did not find any. 
	To account for scans that were not labeled correctly I followed these protocols:
	If scan 1 of 3+ is more similar to the previous plant's gsw values than the following 3+ scans, I removed the first scan. If I could not distinguish a mistaken scan from a series of 4+ scans I did not remove any scans."

 - Use the CSV in R
 - The list of removed scans is in the metadata tab
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gsw_porometer_cleaned.csv/.xlsx------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Porometer measurements cleaned based on stomatal conductance values using the protocols described in the xlsx metadata tab:

	"First I removed gsw values below zero, then I used the three sigma rule to remove outliers, although I did not find any. 
        To account for scans that were not labeled correctly I followed these protocols:
	If scan 1 of 4+ is more similar to the previous plant's gsw values than the following 3+ scans, I removed the first scan. If I could not distinguish a mistaken scan from a series of 4+ scans I did not remove any scans." 

 - There were some scans, noted in the metadata tab, that were not pulled, but are likely incorrectly labeled plants. CSV is for R.
 - The list of removed scans is in the metadata tab

WP_for_R-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Raw stem, predawn, and leaf water potential measurements before cleaning.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WU_for_R-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Raw watering regime data before cleaning.
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clean_WP------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Stem, predawn and leaf water potential measurements. Stem water potential measurements were not altered. LWP measurements were capped at -15 and -3.
	and PD measurements capped at -15 and -1.
	
	Areas are in cm2

12/1 had duplicate wps and leaves for some measurements. I picked the lowest wps in every case,
    #unless a previous note specified otherwise. When leaves were labeled L1 or L2, I picked the corresponding 
    #leaf to the lowest wp.

WaterUse_SWC_Clean.csv----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Soil Water Content and Water Use cleaned following the protocols noted in the code and below: 

Data Cleanup Notes:
11/16
 - Controls were not watered on this day, so there shouldnt be different post water weights. For control plants that had abnormally high (3x) and incorrect watering on this day I removed them. 

11/18
 - There were a few genotypes that went to ALS that only had one plant per treatment. I removed these since one plant shouldnt represent a treatment.

11/27
 - B40-14.8 on 11/27 had the typo of 3.3625 instead of 6.3625 as POWW, I fixed this
 - T485 had incorrect pre water weight entered, since it supposedly gained 2kg of weight in two days. I removed this plant

12/07
 - target weights are not what were used in situ, but what they should have been. However, since the plants on 12/07 recieved new bamboo shoots AND the 
   equation got messed up, the target weight was 90% for control and 20% for drought.

12/09 
 - due to rewatering of treatments on 12/09, the post-water weight column on 12/09
   is the control post water weight from the initial watering and the treatment post water weight
   from the rewater.
 - for water added on 12/09, I combined rthe rewater water added column with the water added column: 
   ifelse(water<0,rewater,ifelse(rewater<0,water,water+rewater))
 - For target weight on 12/09 I used the rewater target of 30% for treatment, instead of 20%.

12/11
 - B42-34.1 had incorrect pre water weights entered, since it supposedly gained 2.5 kg of weight in 3 days. I removed this data point
 - V60-96.9 had one plant for the control group, so I removed it as well

12/13
 - V57-96 control group only had one rep this day, so I removed it

12/15
  - V57-96 control group only had one rep this day, so I removed it

12/16
 - V60-96.9 control only had one rep on this day, so I removed it.
 - SC2 only had one rep per treatment so I removed it.

12/17
- V57-96 control group only had one rep this day, so I removed it
